<p>This is a very simple task in image processing. The alignment happens in two easy steps: first you computer the facial landmarks using your algorithm of choice. Then you take two points that should be parallel, such as the eyes’ outer corners, and rotate the image <i>beta</i> degrees, in order to align these points in the X axis (and the image as a whole).</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate it, I asked my friend Gabriel, If I could use he’s profile picture(he said yes, thanks Gabs).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Before</th>
      <th>Rotating</th>
      <th>After</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="" alt="before" /></td>
      <td><img src="" alt="on" /></td>
      <td><img src="" alt="after" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
